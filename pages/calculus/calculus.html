  <title>The Idea Behind Calculus</title>

  <div class="content">
  <section_start> Introduction </section_start>

  <p>Let's say that we're trying to find the area of a circle. We can divide
    the circle into rings. The length
    of each of these rectangular rings is \(2\pi r\) and the thickness depends on how
    finely we chop up the circle. Let's call this thickness \(dr\), the difference
    in radius from one ring to the next.</p>

    <p>We can place the rectangles together and form a triangle. We can then calculate
      the area of the triangles, as we know that the base length is the same as the
      radius of the original circle and the height is the length of the longest
      ring, \(2\pi r\). </p>

    <equation>\[A=\frac{1}{2}bh=\frac{1}{2}r2\pi r=\pi r^2\]

    <p>We arrive at the formula for the area of a circle.</p>

    <section>Varying dx</section>


    <p>Now, vary the width of
    each slice and the radius of the circle and watch the area calculation become
    accurate.</p>

  <div id="sketch-holder"></div>

  <p> Have a think about the limitations of this model. Are circular rings really
      rectangles? How small does \(dx\) need to be for the answer to be perfect?
